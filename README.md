## Learning objectives

:information_source: **Note:** The instructions in this workshop are taken from the official site https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev. They are a subset from what's available there, so that we can focus soley on the steps we want to accomplish in this workshop.

The Cloud-Native Toolkit is an open-source collection of assets that enable application development and that support teams to deliver business value quickly using a Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Cloud-managed Kubernetes. This workshop shows how the toolkit can be used to support delivering business applications through the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).



The Cloud-Native Toolkit environment has been built to support the principles of a robust SDLC while being flexible enough to fit into a wide range of development settings and toolchains. The Cloud-Native Toolkit supports different tool selections, from open source versions of tools like Artifactory and SonarQube to enterprise-class software like IBM Cloud Pak for Applications and IBM Multicloud Manager. The key benefit is to make the end-to-end CI/CD development lifecycle consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible.

In more detail, in the workshop we'll you'll this part of the workshop covers:

1. Prerequisites (access to an OpenShift cluster, work environment, etc.)

1. Create an application using the Starter Kit

1. Set up a DevOps pipeline for your application

1. Continuous Delivery with Argo CD
